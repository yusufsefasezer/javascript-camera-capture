# JavaScript Camera Capture
JavaScript take photo via webcam

JavaScript Camera Capture App is a user-friendly web application that allows users to view camera feeds and take photos directly from their device's camera. Built using JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3, this app provides a seamless and interactive experience for taking and recording photos.

When the app opens, users are presented with a live camera view displayed on the screen. This is made possible through the use of the HTML5 MediaDevices API, which provides access to the user's camera. Users can see a real-time preview of what their camera is showing, so they can adjust angles or settings as needed.

To take a photo, users simply click on a designated button on the screen. When this button is clicked, JavaScript kicks in. Using the HTML5 Canvas API, the existing camera image is captured and converted into an image. It is then displayed on the screen for users to review.

Users have the option to save the photo by clicking a "Download Photo" button.
